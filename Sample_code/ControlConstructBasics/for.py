# Python program to demonstrate for loops.

# The for loop goes through a list, like foreach in
# some other languages.  A useful construct.
for x in ['Bill', 'Alice', 'Joe', 'Sue' ]:
    print(x, 'likes jelly beans.')

# The range operator simply creates a list of numbers
# in the indicated range.  Note that the range ends
# before the second argument.
print(range(5, 10))

# Range works with for to create the traditional for loop.
